  "description": "A well-known feature of the original Goliath, a Directional Torso Mount acts as a somewhat more restrictive BattleMech shoulder turret, allowing any weapons in the mount to shoot in either the front arc or the rear arc, depending on the mount’s current facing. The mount’s facing is set at the start of the game, and can be changed at the same time torso twists are made. However, unlike a torso twist, it does not reset at each End Phase: the arc chosen remains until deliberately changed. The mount rotates with any torso twist as normal.  Each time a location with a Directional Torso Mount takes a hit (Front or Rear), the player must roll 2D6. A result of 9+ means the mount is destroyed and its weapon locked in its current arc, in addition to the normal effects of the attack.  The 3-point version of this quirk is available only to quad ’Mechs. In this case, the mount operates as a full turret, capable of rotating a full 360 degrees.  No weapon with location placement restrictions (such as a heavy Gauss rifle) can be placed in a Directional Torso Mount",
