If a unit would otherwise not be susceptible to hull breaches, consider it to have a base Hull Breach TN of 12 before applying this modifier. A unit must also make a Hull Breach check when first entering a hostile environment (Vacuum, water, etc). Failure will result in a flood to a random location that is exposed to the hostile environment.",
