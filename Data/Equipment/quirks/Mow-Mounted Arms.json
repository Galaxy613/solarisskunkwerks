  "description": "’Mechs equipped with extremely low-mounted arms—such as the Dark Crow—have mounted their arms far too low to take advantage of the ’Mech’s height advantage. This quirk cannot be combined with the Overhead Arms quirk, nor can it be taken by any ’Mech that either does not have arms, or lacks any form of weaponry in its arms.  A ’Mech with Low-Mounted Arms fires its arm-mounted weapons as if they are actually mounted in the ’Mech’s legs, even though these arms still rotate with the torso position. As a result, these weapons may be blocked from firing by partial cover such as low hills and buildings. By the same token, attacks against ’Mech with Low-Mounted Arms that pass over partial cover cannot strike the ’Mech’s arms either, and instead will strike the covering terrain.",
