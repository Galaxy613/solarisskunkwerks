  "description": "The ammunition feed for one ballistic or missile weapon or bay has a tendency to jam at inconvenient moments. After making a to-hit roll, roll 2D6. On a result of 10+ the weapon jams and cannot be fired again this battle. On a roll of 12, the new round of ammunition will explode in the weapon for normal damage. Per normal rules, Gauss weapon ammunition will not explode, but the weapon itself does.",
