  "description": "A unit with the Obsolete Quirk cannot have any variants in active production and must note the year in which its production ceased as part of the Quirk. After that, the unit will become increasingly hard to maintain ,and its resale price will drop. To reflect this, for every 15 years after production ceases, any rolls to repair or replace equipment on the unit, or to locate parts, will suffer a +1 target number modifer (5+ max). In addition, for every 20 years after production has ceased, the resale cost (but not purchase cost)  will decrease 10% to a max of 50%.",
